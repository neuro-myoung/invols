# Optical Lever Sensitivity Calibration

A streamlit app I used to measure optical lever sensitivity. The code was written to work with data exported in .asc format from HEKA's patchmaster software. If you have a different use case let me know and it may be fairly trivial to adapt the code for your needs.
